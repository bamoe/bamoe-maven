# ${projectName} - ${projectDescription}
This repository contains the `${projectName}` micro-process service, packaged as a micro-service JAR, and was originally generated by the **IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition Maven Archetype** in order to ensure compliancee with Maven best practices. 

# Overview
**Update this section, describing this project, what it does, how it does it, it’s dependencies, test scenarios, etc…**

# How To Build 
Once you have configured your local development environment, you need to perform a Maven `build` of the repository.  This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  If deploying artifacts to an enterprise Maven repository, please use `mvn clean deploy`, which requires configuration of the `distributionManagement` section of your project's parent pom.xml.  This project is also configured to generate container images automatically by utilizing the `container` profile, as in the following example:

```shell
mvn clean package -Pcontainer,<dbtype>
```

The currently supported dbtypes in container mode are `postgresql` and `mssql`. So for example, to build the container image using postgresql database configuration we can run the following command:  

```shell
mvn clean package -Pcontainer,postgresql 
```

# How To Run in Development Mode
Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode, which means you can update the application sources, resources and configurations. The changes are automatically reflected in your running application. This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.  Dev mode enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect. This works too for resource files like the configuration property file. The act of refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the Java files are compiled, and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.  To run the service in Quarkus Dev Mode, use the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package quarkus:dev
```

# Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.2.x) products, specifically the IBM build of [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) known as **IBM Process Automation Manager Open Edition**.
- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on  the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/)

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/get-started/).
