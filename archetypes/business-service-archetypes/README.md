# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions (IBM BAMOE) - Business Service Maven Archetypes
This repository contains custom [**Maven Archetypes**](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html) for creating self-contained business services for rules, decision models, stateless and stateful workflow projects based on [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Edition**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.3.x), which can be run as standalone Quarkus or Spring Boot applications or packaged as a self-contained container image.

# Repository Modules
This is a multi-module repository, with the following modules:

- [**Business Service Archetype**](./business-service-archetype) is an archetype that can create a complete business service that supports stateful processes, rules, and decision models, using either the Quarkus or Spring Boot associated runtimes. 
- [**Stateful Process Business Service Archetype**](./stateful-process-business-service-archetype) is an archetype that can create a stateful process business service, using either the Quarkus or Spring Boot associated runtimes. 
- [**Stateless Process Business Service Archetype**](./stateless-process-business-service-archetype) is an archetype that can create a stateless process business service, using either the Quarkus or Spring Boot associated runtimes. 
- [**Rules Business Service Archetype**](./rules-business-service-archetype) is an archetype that can create a stateless rules (DRL, XLS) business service, using either the Quarkus or Spring Boot associated runtimes. 
- [**Decision Model Business Service Archetype**](./decision-model-business-service-archetype) is an archetype that can create a decision model (DMN) business service, using either the Quarkus or Spring Boot associated runtimes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not create a new project in the same working directory as the `bamoe-maven` repository was cloned into.  This will result in an incorrect Maven project file being generated.  Always create a separate folder to hold your BAMOE Maven projects!

# Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using [**IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.2.x) products, specifically the IBM build of [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org/) known as **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition**.
- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on  the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/)

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/get-started/).

- [**Spring Boot**](https://spring.io/) - Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework.  Spring’s flexible libraries are trusted by developers all over the world. Spring delivers delightful experiences to millions of end-users every day.  Spring’s flexible and comprehensive set of extensions and third-party libraries let developers build almost any application imaginable.  Spring Boot transforms how you approach Java programming tasks, radically streamlining your experience. Spring Boot combines necessities such as an application context and an auto-configured, embedded web server to make microservice development a cinch. To go even faster, you can combine Spring Boot with Spring Cloud’s rich set of supporting libraries, servers, patterns, and templates, to safely deploy entire microservices-based architectures into the cloud, in record time.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Spring Boot**](https://spring.io/quickstart).
